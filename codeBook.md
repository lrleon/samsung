# CodeBook for data processed by functions in run_analysis.R

From

"Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30
subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a
waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors."

## About variable names

The original samsung data containg 561 measurements, already
pre-processed, that were obtained from two transducers: accelerometer
and gyroscope. Both measurements were taken with time and frequency
domain variables. The original data have different types of measures for
those variables; by example, the mean, the standard deviation, the
median absolute deviation. Read the features_info.txt file in order to
get additional information.

There were thirty subjects and the activities monitored were:
* 1 WALKING
* 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* 4 SITTING
* 5 STANDING
* 6 LAYING

As scholar requirement (a course project), but also because that would
be the basis for an initial data analysis, we only take the means of
measurements. Other measures (max, min, energy, etc) are ignored.

The general structure of variable naming is 

  [t|f]Name[Acc|Gyro].[mean|std].[XYZ]

* [t|f] is a prefix indicating the domain of variable; **t** for time and
  **f** for frequency
* Name is the name of variable; it starts with upper case.
* [Acc|Gyro] is the transducer giving the variable. Acc is for the
  accelerometer and Gyro is for the gyroscope
* [mean|std] is the measurement type: mean and std for standard deviation
* In those case where apply the dimensions the suffix .X, .Y or .Z is
  added.

So, by example, the variable tBodyAcc.mean.Z indicates the mean of z
coordinate for the body measure taken by the accelerometer. 

According to the file features_info.txt, the variables could be classified 
* tBodyAcc.XYZ
* tGravityAcc.XYZ
* tBodyAccJerk.XYZ
* tBodyGyro.XYZ
* tBodyGyroJerk.XYZ
* tBodyAccMag
* tGravityAccMag
* tBodyAccJerkMag
* tBodyGyroMag
* tBodyGyroJerkMag
* fBodyAcc.XYZ
* fBodyAccJerk.XYZ
* fBodyGyro.XYZ
* fBodyAccMag
* fBodyAccJerkMag
* fBodyGyroMag
* fBodyGyroJerkMag

Note that these variables have the word ".mean" or ".std" as part of your
names; they are omitted for the sake of "line's economy".

**Note that all above variables represent averages**.

## About the functions in the script run_analysis.R

The original samsung database is divided is two sets located at the
train and test directories respectively. The functions of this file are
intended to process all this data and to extract the mean and standard
deviations of variables already described.

The functions should be executed in R taking as working directory the
root of samsung database.

The most interesting functions are:
* merge.train.with.test.sets() which returns a data frame with the two
  sets merged and the variables extracted (the other are
  discarded). In this data frame the activity is an integer.
* compute.avg.by.subject.and.activity(data) receives a data frame
  obtained by the above function and builds and return a new data frame
  consisting of averages of feature variables of data. This data frame
  has factor for the activity.
* get.and.clean.samsung.data(filename): invokes the above functions (in
  order) and save the resulting data frame in filename. If filename is
  not specified, then the file name will be "samsung-tidy.txt"

The final order of a row is: subject, activity and variables in the same
order presented in the previous section. The row length is 81 in both
data sets.
